# Firefox-TransFlag-Fix
The transgender flag emoji displays as a white flag followed by the transgender symbol on firefox. This replaces that with an actual proper trans flag emoji.
This script is intended to be run on Firefox with TamperMonkey.
It should handle dynamic content with grace, as it only runs when the webpage updates. This also means that it works on dynamic content, and in an efficient manner.
